# mini php framework
 my own simple php framework for routing based on laravel htaccess

There are only 2 function for routing, get and post. Those two functions support param on the path. There are also serveView function to send static html view to client. For data exchange, i only use ajax. There is also a config.php file to change your localhost xampp folder or you can say the parent path so the index.php file can understand to convert from path in processor to match the path in browser.

This repo is an example project itself for the framework.
